# Functions

# A function is like a machine
# It needs to be turned on (called) and it does things (blocks of code)

# Good practices
# They should be small and only do one job
    # Avoid stringy code
    # Testable code
    # Maintainable code
    # Readable code

# DO NOT PRINT inside a function - unless it explicitly suppose to print
# In function you return
# Call the function inside a print(function_name)
# DRY --> Don't Repeat Yourself
# Separation of concerns
    # Define functions in one file
    # Call them in another
    # There is more to this

# Functions work this way:
    # Define a function
    # Call the function

# Syntax
# def <name>(arg1, arg2, arg3):
    # Block
    # Return something if you wish

def say_hello():
    return 'HELLOO'

print(say_hello())

def say_hello_ueser(f_name = 'Shireen', l_name = 'Yawer'):
    return 'Hello ' + f_name.capitalize() + ' ' + l_name.capitalize()

print(say_hello_ueser('Shireen', 'Yawer'))
